# Passenger Counter App

![Design preview for the Passenger Counter App Challenge](images/passenger-video.mp4)

Did you know that The Tube is used by around 2 million people every day? How can we easily count them? It is amazing how small apps can be so helpful in certain professions. What else can we count with it?ðŸ”¢ðŸ¤”

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- VSCode

### What I practised

This challenge is a refresher for my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. I have been focusing on polishing my skills in order to make my code more readable and avoid duplication as much as possible. I found it challenging to find out a way to avoid applying opacity to the elements inside the container. How could I improve the design?

### Continued development

I will keep practising daily CSS/HTML to develop speed from creating a variety of basic components. I will keep learning javascript so I can combine these tools to create apps. I believe if you master the basics, it will be easier to use these skills to build something greater.
